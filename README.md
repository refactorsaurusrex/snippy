# snippy
A low-key, cli-oriented code snippet manager

# Archived
This seemed like a good idea at the time, but the more I used it, the less useful it felt. I'm now using [checkvist](https://checkvist.com) for code snippet management instead. The only reason I'm even keeping this repo public is because I already published the module to the PowerShell Gallery and that cannot be undone. I'm archiving the repo instead.
